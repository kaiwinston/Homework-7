<h3>Explanation</h3>
<body>
<p>I chose this enviornment/image of the Chicago skyline since it’s where a couple close friends of mine just moved off too and where I plan on meeting them in the coming years after I finish my studies at Hunter. I enoy moving around, living in different cities, and somehow I’ve lived in the majority of major cities in the states aside from Chicago. This landscape was chosen to represent what is to come. I chose my triad color scheme through Adobe Color CC and mainly just focused on it coming out visually appealing whilst remaining somewhat clear as to what the landscape was depicting. I transformed it through cutting, morphing, and tracing various shape on Adobe Illustrator.</p>
